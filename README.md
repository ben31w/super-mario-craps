  Super Mario Craps  This project is Super-Mario themed craps game. 
  Note: I do not own the rights to Super Mario or any of the images I ripped off the internet to make this game.
  
  To play this game, run "CrapsDriver.java".
  
  How to play: In order to play, you need to bet money. 
  You can do this using any of the bet buttons or the bet textfield near the top of the frame. 
  Once you have wagered money, you are ready to roll some dice.  
  
  Click the 'initial roll' button. For your initial roll ONLY:
  If you roll a 7 or an 11, you win and receive double what you wagered!
  If you roll a 2, 3, or 12, you lose what you wagered.
  If you roll ANYTHING else (4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10), that new number becomes your 'goal.'
  
  Once you have a goal, click the 'roll again' button. For all subsequent rolls:
  If you roll your goal, you win double your wager!
  If you roll a 7 or an 11, you lose your wager.
  If you roll ANYTHING else, you must keep rolling until you roll your goal, a 7, or an 11.
  
  If you run our of money, the game is over. Your ultimate objective is to earn as much money as possible. Good luck!
