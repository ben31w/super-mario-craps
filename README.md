# super-mario-craps
This project is a Super Mario-themed craps game created with Java JComponents. The game is displayed in a JFrame with clickable JPanels, JButtons, etc.

Craps is a gambling game where you bet money and roll dice. After you bet money, you roll a pair of dice.
For your initial roll:
<ul>
         <li>if you roll a 7 or an 11, you receive double the money you wagered;</li>
         <li>if you roll a 2, 3, or 12, you lose your wager</li>
         <li>if you roll anything else, that nunber becomes your 'goal.'</li>
</ul>

 If you didn't win or lose money on the initial roll, you keep rolling until you hit your goal, or a 7/11.
 <ul>
         <li>if you roll your goal, you receive double your wager</li>
         <li>if you roll a 7 or an 11, you lose your wager.</li>
</ul>

To play this game, run the file "CrapsDriver.java"
It should bring up this frame:

If you click anywhere inside this frame, it will bring up a character select screen:

Once you pick a character, you are ready to begin playing! It will bring up this screen:

The first step in craps is to bet money. Once you have done this, you are ready to roll some dice:

In this case, we rolled a three on the first roll. This causes us to lose our wager:

We bet more money and make another initial roll. We rolled a six, which becomes our goal.

If we roll a six again, we win double our wager!

The goal of the game is keep winning and making money.

I started making this game in high school, and I obviously don't own any rights to Super Mario.
