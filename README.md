# super-mario-craps
This project is a Super Mario-themed craps game.

I coded it using Java JComponents; the game is displayed in a JFrame with clickable JPanels, JButtons, etc.
The game is run through the file "CrapsDriver.java", and the other files are JPanels that specify the game's layout 
and functionality. There's a Dice class that simulates the rolling of a pair of dice. There's also a class for the
title screen, character select screen, and the game screen that the user interacts with.

Craps is a gambling game where you bet money and roll dice. After you bet money, you roll a pair of dice.
For your initial roll:

         if you roll a 7 or an 11, you receive double the money you wagered;
         if you roll a 2, 3, or 12, you lose your wager;
         if you roll anything else, that nunber becomes your 'goal.'
        
 If you didn't win or lose money on the initial roll, you keep rolling until you hit your goal, 7, or 11.
         
         if you roll your goal, you receive double your wager;
         if you roll a 7 or an 11, you lose your wager.
      
I made this game in high school, and I obviously don't own any rights to Super Mario.
